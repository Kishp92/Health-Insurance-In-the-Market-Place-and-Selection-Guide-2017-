# Health-Insurance-In-the-Market-Place-and-Selection-Guide-2017-

## ABSTRACT

An overview of Marketplace Health Insurance to define and analyze metal(tiers) types and plan types based on location and availability. Also includes highlights of average premiums based on age and partnered status along with a guideline to select an insurance plan best suited for the consumer's healthcare needs. 

## Purpose

In my 7+ years in the healthcare management field, there has not been a day at work where a basic question about healthcare insurance has not come up. Yes, it can be confusing with all the plans out there! From patients becoming upset when they realize what they have to pay when they come in for their vist due to poor education about the process, to staff not understanding what they need to collect from the patient, I created these educational dashboards to give the user an idea on how to select a health insurance plan based on their personal needs.
